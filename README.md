# NoSQL_findBusiness
 Use python to implement NoSQL and find businesses base on their locations <br />
 The main python code is in the [NoSQL.ipynb](NoSQL.ipynb) file.<br /> 
 The python code will read the sample.db file, which contains data of businesses, including business id, name, address, city, latitude, longitude...<br />
 FindBusinessBasedOnCity function find the businesses that are in a certain city.<br />
 FindBusinessBasedOnLocation function find the business that are within a certain distance. I calculated the distance based on latitude and longitude.<br />
